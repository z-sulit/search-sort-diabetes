**Project Title:**
Search & Sort Algorithm Implementation (Diabetes Dataset)

**Description:** 
This Python program loads a diabetes dataset and allows the user to interactively search and sort data using classical algorithms. It includes Linear Search, Binary Search with Quick Sort, and three sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, and Quick Sort. The program compares the performance of each algorithm and saves the sorted results into a CSV file.


**Installation:**
You don't need to install time as time is already part of Python's built-in library.
To install Pandas, you need to go to your python command line and type

pip install pandas

**Usage:**
Go to your repository on GitHub.

Click the green Code button and select:

Open with Codespaces → New codespaces

GitHub will launch a VS Code-like environment in your browser.
In the left panel (Explorer), open your .ipynb file.
It will automatically open in Notebook mode (just like Jupyter).
At the top of the notebook, click “Run All” or run individual cells with ▶️.
